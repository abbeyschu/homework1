Horiseon - Code Refactor Assignment

Deployed Application Link: 

The primary goal was to make the Horiseon Marketing site more accessible for all individuals and also optimized for search engines. A secondary goal was to make the page more responsive to browser window size changes.

The most important step of this project was including semantic html elements. This clearly shows the meaning of each element to developers, but also is crucial for screen reader programs. These semantic elements must also follow a logical structure. Other aspects important for screen readers include adding alt attributes to all images and a descriptive title for the browser tab. 

The previous css file did not allow for elements to be responsive to screen/window size. Comments in the css file list specific changes, but they include:
    - flexbox was utilized for the Header, including the navigation menu
    - media queries were added to adjust sections on smaller screen sizes
