# Horiseon - Code Refactor Assignment

## Description
The primary goal was to make the existing Horiseon Marketing site more accessible for all individuals and also optimized for search engines. A secondary goal was to review and consolidate the css style sheet. Additions were also made to make the page more responsive to browser window size changes.

The most important step of this project was including semantic html elements. This clearly shows the meaning of each element to developers, but also is crucial for screen reader programs. These semantic elements must follow a logical structure. Other aspects important for screen readers were also added, including alt attributes for all images and a descriptive title for the browser tab.
